# Web_Scrapper
Program used to create a Dataset based on possible interviewers questions present in this web "https://foxhugh.com/interview-questions/list-of-interview-questions/", the program also uses web scrapping to translate them using Google Traductor, so the result are two different datasets, one in english and one in spanish.

The reason behind using web scrapping to translate itÂ´s because the last Google Traductor API update caused problems to some users and i was unable to use it.

Web Scrapping parts of the code were designed using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries
